Title: GeneCluster: Identification of subtype-specific genes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Quang-Huy Nguyen
Maintainer: Quang-Huy Nguyen <huynguyen96.dnu@gmail.com>
Description: Given a gene from a list of genes of interest, 
    it will be specifically distributed to either of 
    predictive subgroups based on its mean values (e.g., 
    CNA changes, MET changes, and expression levels). 
    Then, a gene was considered as a subtype-specific one 
    if P-value <= 0.05 (one-way ANOVA test). For further 
    information on requirements as well as how to implement 
    this tool, please visit my Github repository:
